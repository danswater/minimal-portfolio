Base on https://github.com/singhkshitij/My-Landing-Page
>One fine day i was going through GitHub and found an awesome concept on [Dinesh Pandiyan's Profile](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page) and saw that people really liked it and so did i. I really liked the minimalist approach and hence thought that i should take it a step forward.
